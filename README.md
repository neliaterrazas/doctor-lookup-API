### Description

An application to check your age on different planets! Then, given an age, the site will tell you how many years you have left on said planet determined by average life expectancy.

### Specs
Take a person's current age translate into ages on other planets. The conversions are as follows:

#### Planets
|   | Conversions  | Expected Age for NT (25)  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|  Mercury  | 0.24/1 Earth Year | 6  |   
| Venus |  0.62/1 Earth Year | 15.5  |   
| Mars  | 1.88/1 Earth Year  | 47  |  
| Jupiter  | 11.86/1 Earth Year  | 296.5  |
#### Life Expentancy
|   | Life Expectancy  |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|

### Technologies and Resources

* HTML
* Karma
* Jasmine
* Javascript

### Responsiveness

This site is still not functional. You are able to see what progress I have made in my galactic-back-end.js , index.js , and galactic.spec.js files.

### Setup Instructions

* Download this repository at https://github.com/neliaterrazas/galactic-calc.git
* $ npm install in the terminal to retrieve node_modules folder
* $ npm run build in the terminal to retrieve dist folder
* Open in your favorite text editor to see said folders
* $ npm run start to open a new tab with the live site/ compile code.
* $ npm run test to open Karma and see the tests live.


### Roadmap
I will have to refactor back end to ES6 and redefine classes, connect the dots on why my getAge() function is only working in Karma and not the actual site, and add life expectancy functions.
